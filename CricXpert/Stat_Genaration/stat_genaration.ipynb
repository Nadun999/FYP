    "        - Use `CAST()` for type conversions instead of `::`.\n",
    "        - Avoid any syntax that is specific to PostgreSQL or other SQL variants.\n",
    "        - Handle multiple conditions, such as filtering by runs, wickets, and specific years.\n",
    "        - Use Common Table Expressions (CTEs) or subqueries if needed to calculate aggregates or percentages.\n",
    "        - Use `DISTINCT` when counting or selecting matches to avoid duplication.\n",
    "        - Use aggregate functions such as `COUNT()` to calculate total counts.\n",
    "        - Make sure to use `GROUP BY` where required when using aggregate functions in select statements.\n",
    "        - Use `NOT IN` subqueries to filter out matches involving certain players when requested.\n",
    "        - Return only the columns that are necessary to answer the user's question.\n",
    "        - If you encounter a player name or any entity that is misspelled, use fuzzy matching or approximate search techniques to identify the closest match.\n",
    "        - To determine match outcomes involving a specific player (e.g., Arshdeep Singh), join `player` and `match_result` tables to verify the country and match outcome respectively.\n",
    "        - Use `t20_match_no` as the unique identifier for each match, linking only batting, bowling, and fielding.\n",
    "        - Focus on matches where a specific player meets the conditions given in the user's question.\n",
    "        - Use a step-by-step approach with Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to break down the query into logical steps:\n",
    "            1. First, identify matches where specific conditions are met (e.g., a player took a certain number of wickets).\n",
    "            2. Then, determine how many of these matches meet another condition (e.g., matches were won by India).\n",
    "            3. Finally, calculate any required performance metrics or counts based on these results.    \n",
    "        - Use the `home_away` column from `batting`, `bowling`, or `fielding` to determine if the match was played at home, away, or neutral.\n",
    "        - When determining the number of matches played, consider using joins across multiple tables (`batting`, `bowling`, etc.) and apply `UNION` if needed to avoid double counting.\n",
    "        - Ensure that the conditions for finals, such as checking `in_finals_id`, are correctly applied to identify final matches.\n",
    "        - Include additional details like `start_date` and `opposition_country_id` to provide more context for match results, such as the opponent team and match date.\n",
    "        - When calculating performance metrics (e.g., economy rate, win percentage when conditions are met), use CTEs or subqueries to first identify relevant matches and then apply aggregate functions to derive the final output.\n",
